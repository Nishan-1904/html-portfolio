  Hello, there! My name is Nishan Chakraborty, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my website. 
  At just 18 years old, I'm already on an exciting journey towards pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science from the prestigious VIT Bhopal university.

  Hailing from the vibrant city of Kolkata in West Bengal, India, I have a deep passion for technology and all things digital. 
  When I'm not buried in code or studying, you can often find me engrossed in the world of football or strategizing my Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team for the next match.

  Apart from my love for sports, I am an avid fan of web shows and movies. 
  Exploring diverse narratives and captivating storylines has always been a great source of inspiration for me.

  Here, on my website, I am excited to share my journey, projects, and achievements with you. 
  Whether it's showcasing my coding endeavors or highlighting my academic accomplishments, this platform is where you can witness my growth and dedication.

  Join me as I take you through my endeavors and experiences, and feel free to explore the projects I've poured my heart into. 
  I hope my website serves as an inspiration to fellow tech enthusiasts, aspiring students, and anyone curious about my world.
